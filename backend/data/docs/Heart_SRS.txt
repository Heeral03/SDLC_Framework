Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

1. Introduction

1.1 Purpose

This SRS describes the functional and non-functional requirements of a
Heart Disease Prediction system using an SVM (Support Vector Machine)
classifier. The system trains a machine-learning model on a heart
disease dataset, evaluates it, and saves the trained model and scaler
for future use.

1.2 Scope

The system loads heart disease data, preprocesses it, trains a linear
SVM model, evaluates its performance, and exports the final model. This
supports downstream usage such as a prediction API or UI.

1.3 Technologies Used

-   Python
-   Pandas, NumPy
-   Scikit-learn
-   Joblib
-   CSV dataset (heart.csv)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Overall Description

2.1 System Overview

The system performs: 1. Data loading
2. One-hot encoding of categorical variables
3. Train-test splitting
4. Feature scaling
5. Model training using SVM
6. Evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix)
7. Saving the model and scaler

2.2 User Classes

-   Developer / Data Scientist: Runs training code and produces the
    model.
-   Model Consumer: Uses generated model for predictions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Functional Requirements

FR-1: Load Dataset

-   System must load heart.csv from the working directory.
-   Must print confirmation and preview.

FR-2: Preprocess Data

-   Must separate target variable (target).
-   Must apply one-hot encoding to categorical columns:
    -   sex, cp, fbs, restecg, exang, slope, ca, thal

FR-3: Split Dataset

-   Must split data into training and testing sets (80/20).
-   Must use random_state=1.

FR-4: Scale Features

-   Must fit StandardScaler on training data.
-   Must transform both training and test sets.

FR-5: Train SVM Model

-   Must train SVM with:
    -   kernel = ‘linear’
    -   random_state = 0

FR-6: Predict & Evaluate

-   Must generate predictions.
-   Must compute:
    -   confusion matrix
    -   accuracy score

FR-7: Save Model

-   Must save:
    -   heart_model.pkl
    -   scaler.pkl

------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Non-Functional Requirements

NFR-1: Performance

-   Model training should complete under a few seconds on a standard
    CPU.
-   Memory usage should remain within dataset limits.

NFR-2: Usability

-   Console logs should clearly indicate progress (loading, encoding,
    training, saving).

NFR-3: Maintainability

-   Code must be modular and easy to integrate into larger systems.

NFR-4: Portability

-   Should run on any environment that supports Python 3 and required
    libraries.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. System Outputs

-   Console logs of each stage
-   Confusion matrix
-   Accuracy score
-   heart_model.pkl
-   scaler.pkl

------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. Constraints

-   Requires scikit-learn-compatible dataset format.
-   Depends on correct columns in heart.csv.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. Future Improvements

-   Add cross-validation
-   Add feature selection
-   Add API for real-time prediction
-   Add visualization of metrics
